gr-custom installation instructions:

$ cp -r <dropbox>/SDR/GNU Radio/gr-custom <local gnuradio dir>/
$ cd <local gnuradio dir>/gr-custom/build
$ cmake ../

There may or may not be an error after running cmake that is 
generated due to a mismatch in directories. If so, edit the
CMakeCache.txt file in the /gr-custom directory as suggested 
and replace all instances of the directory that is mentioned
in the error.

$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

Make sure to reload blocks if you already have GRC running.
