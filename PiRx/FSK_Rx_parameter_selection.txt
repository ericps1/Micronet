RTL Sample Rate:

	The rtl sample rate should be the result of some integer division of its reference frequency, 28.8 MHz. So 2.4/1.2 MHz works well for instance.

Decimation:

	Decimation is not necessary for the receiver to work properly, but it will reduce the load on the CPU.

Samples Per Symbol:

	The number of samples per symbol needs to be equal to the RTL's sample rate divided by any decimation in the signal chain. In general the 		
	sampling point for each symbol will be more accurate the larger the number of samples per symbol because it will detect a rising edge more 	
	quickly. The absolute minimum samples per symbol should be 3.

Filtering:

	Any low pass filters need to have a pass band that extends at least to one half the frequency spacing (carrier to carrier) plus one half the 
	data rate.
